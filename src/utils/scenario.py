# LENGTH-TO-BEAM RATIO (LBR) AND SHIP CATEGORIES
# 
# Ratio       Description                                    Typical Ship Types
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2-4         Small to midsize planing powerboats            Yachts (6-15m, 15-50 knots)
#             Provides stability and spacious deck area      Small fishing boats (9-15m, 10-25 knots)
#             relative to length, suitable for high-speed    
#             recreational use.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3-4         Small to midsize sailboats, motor yachts       Yachts (15-30m, 15-50 knots)
#             Balances stability and speed, suitable         Larger fishing boats (15-30m, 10-25 knots)
#             for both sailing and powerboating.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4-6         Large, efficient long-range cruisers           Ferries (30-50m, 15-30 knots)
#             Designed for fuel efficiency and stability,    Small cargo ships (90-150m, 12-20 knots)
#             ideal for ocean passages.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 6-10        Large freighters, cruising trimarans,          Ferries (50-150m, 15-30 knots)
#             cruising catamarans, and large                 Larger cargo ships (150-180m, 12-20 knots)
#             sailing monohulls                              Icebreakers (60-180m, 10-20 knots)
#             Optimized for long-distance travel, balancing
#             stability and carrying capacity.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 10-16       Fast-cruising catamarans, trimarans,           Naval ships (variable length, 20-35+ knots)
#             and racing multihulls                          Specialized racing boats
#             High LBR for speed and agility, reducing 
#             drag for competitive sailing.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Over 16     Racing multihulls                              Specialized racing multihulls
#             Extreme ratios for ultimate speed,             (e.g., America's Cup racers)
#             lightweight, minimal beam to length for 
#             high performance in racing.
